    "bio": "I build LLM-assisted automation pipelines that replace slow, manual workflows.\n\nI work end-to-end in Python, from problem breakdown to deployment, for both self-hosted and cloud setups. In past projects, these systems have reduced manual work by up to 80–90%.\n\nIf you need a workflow automated, an AI system fixed, or a clean prototype built fast, reach out.",
